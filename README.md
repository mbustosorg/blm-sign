BLM Neon Voices (#blmneonvoices)
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mbustosorg/blm-sign.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mbustosorg/blm-sign)

In reaction to police violence and racism, a group of Bay Area artists and creators have collaborated to create Neon Voices, a large-scale, modular display with potent anti-racism statements and images. The artworks incorporate LED lighting and effects for high-visibility impact. In collaboration with community members, the artists plan to install the artwork on prominent Bay Area buildings and open spaces. The first installation is a “BLACK LIVES MATTER” sign featuring a striking graphic designed by local Oakland artist, [Abi Mustapha](https://abimustapha.com).  This sign is currently on display at the [Rising Sun Center for Opportunity](https://risingsunopp.org/) building in Emeryville and is visible from I-580 to thousands of cars daily.

This is the open source repository (MIT License) that will contain all the construction information for the Black Lives Matter sign that is currently deployed on top of the building owned by .  We'll be including software, bill of materials, assembly instructions, budget and tips and tricks on how to assemble a similar sign for your own statements for racial equity.  The project is entering the next phase of development and we'll keep updating here with more detailed information.
